reading this morning is from Psalm 119. we're going to read the first 18 verses if you want to go there uh ah it's good to see my brothers and sisters um happy to be back and uh look forward to uh chance to Worship in song and in prayer and to dive into the Lord's word today all right so let's uh read we're gonna read the first 18 verses this is Psalm 119. blessed are those whose ways are blameless who walk according to the law of the Lord blessed are those who keep his statues and seek him with all their heart they do no wrong but follow his ways you have laid down the precepts that are to be fully obeyed oh that my ways were steadfast in obeying your decrees then I would not be put to shame when I consider all your commands I will praise you with an upright heart as I learn your righteous laws I will obey your decrees do not utterly forsake me how can a young person stay on the path of Purity by living according to your word I seek you with all my heart do not let me stray from your commands I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you praise be to you Lord teach me your decrees with my lips I recount all the laws that come from your mouth I rejoice in following your statutes as one rejoices in great riches I meditate on your precepts and consider your ways I Delight in your decrees I will not neglect your word be good to your servant while I live that I may obey your word open my eyes that I may see the wonderful things in your law open my eyes that I may see the wonderful things in your law so it's a little bit embarrassing but it's only been the last few years that uh I discovered something like really understood something that's I guess should have been obvious uh and that is that God's laws aren't arbitrary see my bent is to be a good soldier right here's right here's wrong do this don't do that right I got my marching orders be a good soldier the trouble with being a good let me correct that the trouble with trying to be a good soldier only gets you so far right so um open my eyes and I may see the wonderful things in your law so in the um what is it oh I'm gonna get it wrong I think uh the fifth commandment they say that's the only one uh with a promise right on your father and mother that it may right so um that's both true but it's also misleading okay it's true and that it's true it's written that's what the one it is it's misleading in that it's the only law with a promise okay I'm not talking about Prosperity Gospel like money flowing from the sky I'm talking about joy and purpose uh in our lives in the lives of those that we love that flows from uh honoring and obeying God's laws so if I know that how do I how do I know that how do I how do I get to the point where I can really trust that that's true and have the power to actually execute on that right well this is a good news bad news thing right it's a gift it's a gift of Grace from God for both the trust and the power right so how do we get the how do we receive those gifts of Grace right well by orienting our lives in such a way that we are able to receive them there's things that we can do practical things that we can do to orient ourselves in a way to receive that and I know as we're all Protestant church here so we're like that's you know the Radar's off a little bit on the uh you know Salvation is by faith alone in Christ alone I'm not talking about salvation I'm talking about now okay so if you'd like to continue this conversation with me I will be in the pastor's office uh uh after the service or if you just like to pray with me I would love to pray with you all right let me open us in a word of Prayer Lord open my eyes that I may see that I may see the wonderful things in your law yes Lord let this uh song be our prayer Lord turn Our Eyes Upon Jesus help us to look in his wonderful face so that the things of this Earth May grow strangely dim in the light of his glory and grace amen amen amen last week we

Folks there they go I was telling bill this morning and maybe I don't know which side of the which side of the spectrum you're on but many people struggle with uh depression um a feeling a feeling of inadequacy a feeling of uh a troubled life in general and uh and we empathize with those people and uh but me personally I I never really experienced that in my life I've always lived a good life Lenny I remember remember hearing Lenny sharing his testimony one night here on Sunday night and he said I've just had a good life all my life I've been things have been good all my life and so we sing a song like that I cry where the writer says when peace cannot be found and when sleep won't visit me tonight A Restless mind that I can't tame I walk the floor I call your name finally silence and the tears Begin to Fall and then I cry and you're the one who hears me calling so we we do sing those songs and hopefully they're encouraging for someone who's uh who may be going through troubled

hard things particularly the hard things that we could be the people you intended us to be and be a light to the people of this community of course in Jesus name I pray amen compromising for the most part is a good thing when the issue being debated can be compromised most of us Democrats or Republicans wish that the Congress and the Senate would do more compromising and less fighting if they could they could get more done but sadly most of the time they don't do they that being said when it comes to matters of Truth biblical truth compromise is not good and in fact becomes something evil truth particularly God's truth cannot be compromised it can only be accepted or rejected and so to compromise truth is to change the truth into some something less into the opposite into a lie we talked about that EXT extensively last week and and uh and yet I think we can use this as a Point of Departure to move in another Direction this week and so what kind of pickup where we left off most people are unaware of the terrible pressure exerted on president-elect Lincoln in the winter of 60 and 61 a bill was brought to Washington representing a compromise that would Grant certain concessions to the Southern States ensuring the existence of slavery for decades to come and yet at the same time containing to some degree its expansion it was a true compromise now senators from the North and the South Business Leaders editors clergy counseled Lincoln and begged Lincoln to consider this accommodation a lot of pressure was put on him from every point in the country even William Stewart the incoming Secretary of State retreated from his formerly hard-line position and advised the young president-elect to compromise but Lincoln would not Pulitzer prize-winning author historian and Christian John Meacham wrote that Lincoln courageously resisted compromising on slavery in an hour when such a compromise was within the realm of acceptable opinion acceptable public opinion the president-elects steadfastness in the winter of 1860 and 61 helped make the end of slavery possible in these cold and complex months Abraham Lincoln with both Statesman and moral being choosing the difficult over the easy the catastrophic over the convenient the right over the wrong in so doing Lincoln opened the door to a war that would claim over half a million American lives and lay waste to the southern half of the nation and seal his own Doom by refusing to support the proposed Bill Lincoln became the most hated president in American history by those in both the North and the South but his refusal to compromise would in the end achieve something profoundly good considering the day of Lincoln's assassination Meacham wrote this toward the end of his his book says the son set in Washington at 6 44 pm on Friday April 14 1865. and the president was as was his habit having coffee after supper and as he prepared to depart for Ford's Theater Lincoln carried his China cup to the southernly facing suite and set it on one of the two window sills in his bedroom he was wearing a black Brooks Brothers suit a gift for his second inauguration leaving in his carriage for the theater Lincoln donned a hat that bore a morning ribbon he had first affixed to it after Willy's death three years before in his pocket the president carried a leather wallet in which he kept a collection of newspaper clippings there was John Bright's letter to Horace Greeley a comparison of the 1864 party platforms accounts of the Emancipation in Missouri and General Sherman's orders to his troops but one article included an excerpt from a British newspaper most likely I would assume that poor old Lincoln carried around he probably read it every once in a while just to encourage his own mind because so many hateful and terrible things were written about the man perhaps he kept this to just kind of encourage himself and move himself along but this is what it said in a copy of the Liverpool Daily Press concerning Lincoln absolute truth Stern resolution clear Insight solemn faithfulness courage that cannot be daunted hopefulness that cannot be dashed these are qualities that go a long way to make up a hero and it would not be easy to dispute Mr Lincoln's claim to all of these to compromise would have been wrong and so he didn't in the end it cost him everything he had but what he did and what he refused to do will forever be remembered as right right matters always has always will today we live in a culture that beckons to us from every media Source on the planet to compromise God's truth concerning human sexuality we cannot and we must not compromise we must instead hold to the whole truth for God and His truth never change we who have made a commitment to Christ are tasked to share the unchanged truth of God not some altered version with the world regardless of popular opinion persecution difficulty or strife we discussed this last week at some length if we are to share the truth with the world successfully it cannot be a half-truth or compromise truth it must be the whole truth well how do we do that Pastor how how with love and patience persistence and humility if you have a son or a daughter a grandchild or a parent or friend who Embraces today's sexually liberal culture the philosophy of our time that you can do as you please and discard this the laws of God the key to helping them is love the key to helping them is love well we've tried talking to them Pastor we've tried persuading them we've given them books we've we've argued we've debated we've and they just they just won't listen they just won't listen they just want no no no love will help them you will not persuade them they must be loved in such a way that they see God in you and God the Holy Spirit Will persuade them to make a decision for themselves Christ's Parable concerning the prodigal provides a model which when implemented with love and patience can help your loved one your neighbor retrace their steps find New Direction much in the same way you and I did when we willingly laid aside our personal will in favor of his regardless of of what we struggle with in the world whatever sin we struggle with in the world uh we have to come to grips with that ourselves and no one can do it for us and I think most of you probably remember coming to grip with certain things in your life okay I do let's take a look at the parable just quickly Luke chapter 15 you're all most all of you are very familiar with the parable and so we will try to move along in your Pew Bible under the seat in front of you page 1048 Luke 15 starting with verse 11. it says Jesus continued there was a man who had two sons the younger one said to his father father give me my share of the estate so he divided his property between them not long after that the younger son got together all he had and set off for a distant country and there he squandered his wealth in Wild living and after he had spent everything there was a severe famine in the whole country and he began to be in need and so he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country who sent him into the field to feed pigs he longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating but no one gave him anything it's it's funny when young people go out in the world it's that's one of the first things they learn if they learn anything that nobody will give you anything and that's a good thing to learn when he came to his senses when this young guy came to his senses he said how many of my father's hired servants have food to spare and here I am starving to death I will set out and go back to my father and I will say to him father I have sinned against heaven and against you I'm no longer worthy to be called your son make me like one of your hired servants so he got up and he went to his father and while he was still a long way off his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him and he ran to his son and through his arms around him and kissed him and the son said father I have sinned against heaven and against you and I am no longer worthy to be called your son and and but the father interrupted him in mid-speech but the father said to the servants quick he said bring the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet and bring the fat and calf and kill it and let us feast and celebrate for this son of mine was dead and is alive again he was lost in his found so they began to celebrate now meanwhile the other son the older son was in the field and when he came near the house he heard the music and the dancing and so he called one of the servants and he asked him what's going on your brother has come he replied your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound the older brother became angry and refused to go in so the father went out and pleaded with him but he answered his father look all these years I've been I'm enslaving for you and never disobeyed your orders yet you never gave me a young goat so that I could celebrate with my friends now I'm not sure any of that was true but he was complaining verse 30. but wasn't this son of yours who squandered your property with prostitutes comes home you kill the fat and calf for him my son the father said you're always with me everything I have is yours but we had to celebrate and be glad because your brother of yours who was dead is alive again and he was lost and is found there are three main characters in the parable the wise and loving father the judgmental and critical uh uh son and the younger son who had gone astray besides being a picture of a merciful god who extends forgiveness to the penitent the parable also provides I believe a way for a Believer to reach those who have strayed from the true path and help them find their way home and for whatever reason okay the first thing to note is that the father did not chase after the Wayward Son God does not chase after us because God is no fool he knows the path we take for good or ill is ours to choose that's why it doesn't chase us it's ours to choose he gave us that right he gave us that choice along with volition the right to choose God gave us his truth he showed us the miracle of creation he gave us a mind and a heart capable of making a choice so then having given us all the tools that we needed God patiently waits for us to figure it out and so he assumes what appears to be a passive position his love for the wayward soul is unquestionable his wisdom Flawless his patience extraordinary so God Waits and watches and hopes giving to us every Advantage giving to us every tool that we need he does not force the issue no one will ever say God made me do this or God made me do that or God Made Me Do the other thing God says you choose you choose a good parent or sibling or child or friend realizes that God like God the final choice is not theirs if you have a son or daughter who declare themselves to be gay or if you have a a friend who was a man and now wants to be a woman or is a woman wants to be a man and or or two women who live together and and and are intimate it it's their choice if the Wayward individual is to be reached if they are to correct their course they must choose for themselves if I can tell you one thing after being a pastor for such a long time I can't change anybody's mind I couldn't tell you how many Sundays I came in here and beat this pulpit and tried to change people's minds I can change no one's mind because it's yours and you will do as you please regardless of anything that ever comes out of my mouth regardless of anything that comes out of the word of God regardless of anything that happens to this world you will do as you please that's who we are that's human nature if the person we're trying to reach or help in this sexual Quagmire if their change of heart is to be genuine if it is to be true if it is to last the choice must be theirs and theirs alone therein lies the need for patience and love so a good parent sibling child a friend realizes that they cannot choose for the one that they love even though they're they're in error they can hope they can pray they can love they can keep the door of relationship open with that person you can become a better listener and a better friend but like the wise father you must be willing to wait but you have to keep the door of relationship open that's why it doesn't pay to condemn or to attack or try to argue it away the wise father's patience pays off the scriptures say that the young son came to his senses he came to himself he made his own decision and that's what we need to wait for for them to make a decision for them to come to their senses but he had to do this alone he had to do it alone the choice had to be his and his alone in this particular case he realized that what he owed his father at the same time he realized his father never really owed him anything but he had to realize that alone he had to realize that in suffering in the case of someone lost in our cultures new sexual permissiveness they like the prodigal discover on their own they have to discover on their own the truth of their own mistake the truth of their own choice sensual pleasure is at the center of it all um the things that appeal to us in a sensual sense when the Bible talks about Eve looking at the fruit of the tree she saw it was desirable for food desirable for knowledge that it was attractive there are things in this world which are pleasurable right and yet those pleasurable things can be problematic if we put those before the truth of God the terrible terrible overwhelming power of appetite as DJ Walt put it appetite he used the word and that's the proper word whether it be for food or alcohol or sex or drugs oftentimes Catches Us unaware it is so powerful and we may say Well it has no effect over me but it does doesn't it something does something in this life that we enjoy or we desire and it wields great power over us addictive behavior is what follows when we give in to sensual pleasures the struggle to overcome addiction is long and difficult and lonely but when it is successful when it is successful it almost always includes someone who loves you and who is willing to walk with you however long it takes to get back on the right track and who will put up with everything and anything in the meantime it almost always includes that person and that person is a wonderful person because they're willing to go the distance in love and be abused at the same time sometimes considerably abused the oldest son is self-righteous and arrogant seeing himself as good and faithful but he was really neither he just saw that in his own eyes his judgmental and critical spirit towards his younger brother reveals his lack of compassion and forgiveness those who condemn others who have aired particularly those caught in the webs of addiction to some Earthly pleasure like sensuality could really never help them find peace or victory over that addiction because their tendency to be critical and to condemn it doesn't it doesn't help it doesn't help so the older brother becomes an example of what not to do when dealing with someone struggling with the world's lies concerning their sexual identity okay uh the older brother is an example of what not to do his father seeks to explain and to teach the older brother but is rejected and so as with the younger he would probably have to wait for the older brother to figure it out we're never told whether the older brother does or not uh the account goes no further it's left to our imagination when the younger returns he is rejected by his older brother but then probably amazed and dare I say shocked by the love of his wife's father he came back to be a servant he came back to get a job he came back to sleep in a dry building in a bed and eat good food because he wasn't getting any of those things where he was he said I'll just go back and I'll be a good employee and that'll be a great life I'm going to be an employee I'm going to work my old man is the boss that's what I want but he got infinitely more than that didn't he he's restored to his original position the father now demonstrates to the son the magnitude of his love which is considerable In This Moment the sun begins to realize what a terrible fool he had been the love he had forfeited by refusing to come home to his father I can only begin to imagine what went through his mind foreign that he he he was in the employment of someone in a foreign land feeding pigs and starving and living living in squalor and filth thinking my father always loved me my father would always take me back why didn't I come why didn't I listen why did I do what I did these are good questions we should ask ourselves now for the first time the younger brother begins to understand the wonderful unmerited favor the grace and the unconditional love his father extends to him his father who should have been offended his father who should have been hurt his father who should have been angry his father who should have said I told you so did none of that unlike his vindictive brother the father reflected the love of God to his son plain and simple plain and simple if we would if we're to win others back to the path to the right path it will be by loving them and it'll be quite a proposition it'll take some time so put on your safety belt and get in for the Long Haul but you just need to love them love them to the point it makes them nuts and then love them some more and when they get angry and yell at you and say I'm sick of you and sick of your love love them some more the great Theologian J.I packer once wrote that what matters supremely therefore is not in the last analysis the fact that I know God but the larger fact which underlies it that he knows me I am Graven on the palms of his hands I'm never out of his mind all my knowledge of him depends on his sustained initiative in knowing me I know him because he first knew me and continues to know me he knows me as friend one who loves me there's no moment when his eye is off me or his attention distracted from me no moment therefore when his care falters this is momentous knowledge there's unspeakable comfort in knowing that God is constantly taking knowledge of me in love and watching over me for my good there's a tremendous relief in knowing that his love is utterly realistic based at every point on prior knowledge of the worst about me so that no Discovery now can disillusion him about me in a way I am so often disillusioned about myself and quench his determination to bless me It's a Wonderful thought that God knows us and More Than This that he loves us and not only when we get better but God loves us right now as we are with all of our flaws this is how we are called to love those who are lost in the sexual confusion of our present day people who are struggling with their identity and that's what it is plain and simple there's a verse in Ephesians it tells husbands to love their wives uh as Christ loved the church the scriptures are replete with verses to charge Christians to love their parents to love their children to love their friends and to love their enemies we who believe are challenged again and again to emulate the love of God toward humankind we are to emulate the love of God toward humankind for it is that love that will help them see and hear God it is the part of our personal witness that is the most potent and so the most effective not your command of apologetics not your command of scripture not your ability to debate and win the debate but to show the love of God well I've heard this before Pastor Hartley we'll hear it again foreign and keep hearing it because it's the only thing that works Jesus said love the Lord your God with all your heart soul and mind and love your neighbor as yourself John said God is love whoever lives in love lives in God and God in them this is how love is made complete Among Us that's that's quite a statement made complete Among Us that's that's a whole other sermon or a book Paul said love is patient love is kind this is how we're to treat them love is patient love is kind it does not envy it does not boast it is not proud it does not dishonor others it does not dishonor others it is not self-seeking it is not easily angered he keeps no record of wrongs and underline there for you love does not Delight in evil but rejoices with the truth that means love never compromises you can't compromise the truth of God and still love the person you're trying to reach you can't do it if you love someone you tell them the truth allowing them to live in a lie without challenging that lie is not love love does not Delight in evil but rejoices with the truth it always hopes it always perseveres it never fails and now these three remain faith hope and love but the greatest of these is love as we try to love them there will be struggle and hurt and pain and insults and verbal and in some cases even physical abuse they will scream at you and they will tell you that they hate you and they hate your God and they hate your Bible and that if you really love them you'd let them do what they want to do you'd encourage them and support them in what they have chosen but you can't give in to that do not falter or waver love them all the more hold always to the truth for it's God's truth and in the end will set them free if you do not faint we'll say Pastor Hartley what are the little children and the things they're teaching in school what are the little children you're talking to us of adults and people who can we can talk with and spend time with and interact with what about little children well we must supplement and correct what the world teaches and what they're being given in school not all of us can afford Christian School not all of us are in a position to afford to homeschool and so we will have to deal some will have to deal with public school and that's hard and and but you can supplement what they're getting as they are able to understand what it is you're talking about because some of this kind of discussion can't happen with very young children it shouldn't happen with very young children because they don't have the cognitive emotional or mental skills to handle this kind of a discussion and it should not be raised you must raise your children in The Counter Culture of God's truth God's family give them a sure foundation on which to build a world view of Truth and in time they will put together the bits and pieces you can help them put the bits and pieces together as they grow have your kids in Sunday connections have your kids and Pioneer girls have your kids in Battalion have your kids in Stockade have your kids in youth group have your kids here every time there's a potluck every time there's something fun have them here let them grow up in a Christian Community where they see a peer group who follows God where they have examples of adults who follow God raise them up in that community and they will have the tools to sort this out and stand true and endure the lies and things being fed to them from other sources but you need to give yourself to that family that's the Wonder of a local church that's the benefit of a local church is that you've got this really great support system you can raise your kids up in and they can have great friends here and great friends in school too but they know that here what the truth is and they're given the truth that's why we we get you don't forget this little pink sign up over there on the on the the cube Nursery Junior Church stuff like that all those things are imperative we do this because we have to do this because no one else will teach them no one else will show them the way it is imperative that we create and maintain an environment here where families can come and bring kids and those kids can be given the foundational ideas of Truth and take them for the rest of their lives that sounds like a lot of work Pastor Harley it is it is but when you became a parent that's what you signed on for so don't whine all right well I'm a grandparent now so I'm done with that or I'm over 60. I'm done with that well bunkers on that you mean you don't want to help anymore you put in your time so that you just let the young kids struggle for themselves you know how encouraging it is to a young man or young woman when when an older gentleman an older woman are helping out in some of these Ministries and some of these things we have to help each other why because it's impaired that these kids get the truth okay God promises his spirit and his strength as we seek to help our children and our grandchildren move ahead in an Ever darkening world he promises his help for all of these endeavors hymn writer and poet Annie Johnson Flint wrote and I love this she said God hath not promised sky is always blue flower strewn Pathways all our lives through God hath not promised son Without Rain Joy without sorrow peace without pain but God hath promised strength for the day rest for the labor and light for the way Grace for the trials help from above unveiling sympathy and Undying Love so Paul said be steadfast unmovable and always abounding in the work of the Lord for you know your labor in the Lord is not in vain hold your guns hold to the truth do your job hold to it regardless of what the world does regardless of the direction they take regardless of what they call you how they persecute you how they ridicule you the world is a dark place in getting darker all the time but the hero the Christ is coming and with him the dawn of a new day in a new world and a new universe if you're committed to him you'll see that day until then fear not fear not hold of the truth love those who need it most and God will love and keep you until that day and then forevermore so we look to the end of the story in Hope of what shall be okay enough said next week we go back to Acts 15 minutes over I should be fired but I've been around much too long you won't do that let's pray father Lord God bless your people give us wisdom and more than wisdom Lord give us love help us consider the love that you extend to us that we might emulate it and extend it to others those who so desperately needed we pray for our friends and our children and our relatives and and our neighbors all those who struggle with hard things and wander in a world father seeking a path seeking the truth Lord I pray that they might see bits and pieces of that truth in US that you might use us to help them find their way and law that you would give us infinite and endless patience as we seek to love them thank you for this day we thank you for the sunshine we thank you for the breath that you give us Lord use us to your glory words in Jesus name I pray amen good morning foreign [Music] foreign",
